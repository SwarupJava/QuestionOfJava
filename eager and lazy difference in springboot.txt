lazy loading object need to create
https://github.com/Java-Techie-jt/annotations-cheatsheet/blob/main/src/main/java/com/javatechie/spring/LazyLoadingBean.java

start application
egaer loading object created

eager loading object i am not using any where. it means spring boot is eager loading.

when you run application for lazy loading.
you need to annotate with @Lazy annotation on the class and you need to inject the class with @Autowired. so spring will initializae the bean.
